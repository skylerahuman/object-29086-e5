## Outer Sphere — Degradation Mechanisms

Four simultaneous stressors operate on the hull and all fasteners continuously:

**1. Radiation bombardment**

- Constant X-ray and gamma flux from the accretion disk
    
- Degrades materials at the molecular level
    
- Embrittles fasteners, weakens welds over time
    

**2. Thermal cycling**

- Disk-facing side: hot enough to feel through a suit with insulation
    
- Anti-disk side: cold enough for exhaled breath to fog inside a helmet
    
- Metal expands and contracts each cycle — fatigues joints and threads
    

**3. Structural vibration**

- Frequency: 3–7 Hz, felt in the bones before heard
    
- Source: Throat tubes responding to tidal fluctuations
    
- The entire outer sphere oscillates like a struck bell, continuously
    
- Pitch changes with quasar pulse cycle — engineers learn to read it diagnostically
    

**4. Magnetic flux variation**

- Disk and jet-driven electromagnetic field variations induce eddy currents in metal
    
- Lorentz forces physically torque bolts, brackets, and joints
    
- Under certain flux conditions, induced currents cause **faint corona emission** from metal fasteners and brackets — blue at the edges, visible in darkness (this is physically real: St. Elmo's fire / field emission corona)
