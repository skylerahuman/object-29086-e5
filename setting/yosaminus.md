# The Yosaminus

The Yosaminus orbits just outside the **Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)** of a quasar-active supermassive black hole. The ISCO is the innermost radius where circular orbital motion remains stable; inside it, any object spirals inward inevitably.

**Reference mass range used in worldbuilding:**

- Extreme case: ~6.6 billion solar masses (comparable to TON 618)
  - Schwarzschild radius: ~1,300 AU
  - Event horizon diameter: ~2,600 AU (swallows the solar system 40+ times)
  - Tidal forces at ISCO: survivable for large structures due to the gradient being distributed over enormous distances

- Moderate quasar-scale: ~100 million solar masses
  - Event horizon diameter: ~300 million km (~2× Earth's orbital radius)

**What the accretion disk looks like from the outer sphere:**

- Fills roughly half the sky, not a thin ring — a structured luminous plane wrapping the event horizon
- Inner edge: white-blue plasma; outer disk shades to searing orange-red
- Radiation type: hard X-ray and gamma (from friction and magnetic turbulence in the plasma)
- **Relativistic jets** emerge from the polar axes — columns of magnetized plasma and high-energy particles at significant fractions of _c_
- **Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs):** hot spots in the inner disk orbit the black hole at relativistic speeds, producing periodic flares — each reaching the outer hull as a wave of increased radiation, particle flux, and EM stress

**The event horizon's visual appearance:**

- Does not look like a hole — appears as a black sphere of absolute stillness
- Ringed by a gravitationally lensed bright halo: photons from the far side of the disk bent in arcs around it

## The Yosaminus — Physical Dimensions

|Parameter|Value|
|---|---|
|Total diameter|1.6 km|
|Outer sphere radius|800 m|
|Outer sphere surface area|~8 km²|
|Throat zone thickness|500 m (between inner and outer spheres)|
|Throat zone volume|~2 billion m³|
|Inner sanctum radius|300–400 m|
|Actual crew complement|~3,000–7,000 people|

**The Roman miscount:** Roman researchers found the 500 m Throat zone (structurally complex, semi-hollow after magnetorheological fluid drainage and membrane decay) and applied a modest pre-industrial urban density (~0.010 people/m³). That yields ~20 million. The actual living space was only the inner sanctum. The ratio of machine-to-person was enormous.

**Outer sphere geometry:**

- Equatorial circumference: ~5 km (walkable in ~1 hour on flat surface)
- Inner surface studded with ~600,000 Throat tube anchor collar rings
- No windows — radiation levels would blind sensor arrays within hours

## Population Note for Roman Misidentification Scene

Archaeological misread is scientifically defensible:

- **Pre-industrial urban density** applied to cave/ruin surveys: ~0.010 people/m³ is a reasonable heuristic for multi-story warrens
- Applied to 2 billion m³ of Throat zone → ~20 million estimated inhabitants
- Actual inner sanctum at 300–400 m radius: volume ~113–268 million m³ → 3,000–7,000 people at comfortable habitation density
- The Throat zone is structurally complex enough post-decay to read as collapsed multi-story architecture — armature skeletons of 600,000 tube housings would look like building frames
