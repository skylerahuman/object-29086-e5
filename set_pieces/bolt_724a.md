**Bolt spec:** M80-equivalent threaded rod, collar fastener on a Throat tube anchor flange, located behind a radiation baffle panel.

**Daily back-out rate:** exactly 1.2 turns per day.

**Cause:** Accumulated micro-torque from the combination of magnetic flux-induced Lorentz forces, thermal expansion/contraction cycles, and low-frequency structural vibration. These three mechanisms are additive and — critically — consistent, because the quasar's output is periodic and the ship's orbital position is stable. The back-out rate is not random. It is a deterministic result of a stable physical environment.

**The displacement log:** The bolt's positional displacement must read **0.00000** after tightening. If it does not, the ship recalibrates its positional model at Collar Band 7, which cascades to Bands 6 and 8 — a "corrective event." The AI cannot self-verify this measurement. Surt is the verification.
