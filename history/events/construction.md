# Construction Timeline

## Phase 1: Outer Frame Seeding (Years 0–12)

**Autonomous probe swarm (launched from origin system, arrived via 0.1c relativistic coast):**

- 1,000 construction drones (each 50 tons, fusion-powered)
- Magnetic scoops harvest disk corona plasma (ionized Fe, Si, C at 10^6 K)
- 3D-print carbon nanotube truss lattice (800 m radius spherical frame)
- Frame rotates at ISCO velocity (station-keeps via ion thrusters fed by disk material)
- **Output:** 10^6 tons CNT frame with 600,000 pre-drilled collar mounts

## Phase 2: Pod Arrival (Years 12–87, Overlapping with Phase 3)

**Pod launch sequence (from origin, 10 LY away):**

- 300 pods launched serially (1 every 3–4 months early, 1 every 2 months late as swarm scales production)
- Each pod: 20 cryo-sleep colonists + AI bootstrap + compact bioreactor seed culture
- Trajectory: 0.3c cruise (relativistic rockets), decelerate via mag-sail in disk corona, final approach via aerobraking
- **Casualty rate:** 8% (24 pods lost to radiation/collision/decel failure) — 276 successful arrivals
- Arrived pods: robotic arms on frame dock to temporary equatorial slots (low-g parking orbit while awaiting belt assignment)

## Phase 3: Throat Extension & Belt Assembly (Years 15–87)

**As pods arrive, they self-assemble into belts:**

1. Pod deploys MR-fluid Throat tube (720 m, telescoping segments, pre-loaded in pod hull)
2. Tube anchors to frame collar via bolt array (Surt's type × 2,000/pod)
3. Pod activates Throat peristalsis → tube "crawls" inward toward sanctum center
4. Every 10 pods at same radius → EM septa engage → belt locks into toroid
5. Belt begins rotation (ω set by radius for target g)
6. Next belt stacks axially (30 belts total by Year 87)

**Central axis emergence:**

- Lares processors contributed by each pod (collective: 10^18 FLOPS by Year 50)
- Fusion taps installed by Belt 15 (Year 60) → power self-sufficiency
- Light tube activated Year 75 → first "sunrise" in sanctum

**Population growth:**

- Year 12–30: 1,000 people (crew only, no births)
- Year 30–60: 3,500 (first generation born, families form)
- Year 60–87: 6,000 (peak capacity, all belts populated)

## Phase 4: Operational Steady State (Years 87–~300, Then Decay)

**Maintenance regime established:**

- Daily: 50 Throat workers (Surt's cohort) inspect bolts
- Weekly: Pod bioreactor harvest, waste processing
- Monthly: Drone resupply, pod rotation shuffles
- Yearly: Outer frame ablative tile replacement (disk radiation erodes hull)

**Decay onset (Year ~300?):**

- Unknown triggering event (Lares memory corruption? QPO surge? Crew doctrinal schism?)
- MR fluid drainage (Throat tubes solidify or rupture)
- Pod isolation increases (septa EM systems fail → manual latches only)
- By discovery (Roman Era, Year ~4800?): ship is tomb, Surt one of last survivors
