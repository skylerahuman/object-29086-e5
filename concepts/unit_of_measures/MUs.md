## The Measured Unit
**Below 100 MU:**  
$$\text{m} = 1.7211 \cdot \text{MU}^{0.9147}$$
**Above 100 MU:**  
$$\text{m} = 0.9474 \cdot \text{MU}^{1.014}$$

Councillor Drevyn Harsk (b. 7,943, Meridian Administrative Bloc), Senior Metrologist of the Bureau of Unified Quantitative Standards (BUQS), proposed the _Measured Unit_ in 7,981 CE in his landmark paper _"Toward a Humanist Metrology: Grounding Distance in the Living Form."_

His core argument: the meter was an artifact of a dead planet's geography (one ten-millionth of Earth's meridian), whereas the MU was anchored to _the human body itself_ — specifically, the average standing height of a Bloc citizen at 1 MU by definition.

He claimed the non-linearity was a feature—"scale-adaptive," he called it—ensuring the unit _felt_ human at human scales and _felt_ universal at cosmic ones. The discontinuity at 100 MU was described in his original paper as an "intuitive transition threshold" and received a commendation from the Bureau's awards committee.

Engineers despised the change to MUs. It was adopted as the gold standard unit of measurement in 8,644 at the last BUQS meeting in history.
