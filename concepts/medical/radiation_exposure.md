# Radiation Exposure

- **Dosimeter ticks constantly** throughout the Throat — Surt no longer watches it
- Outer hull radiation is sufficient to degrade sensor arrays in hours
- Long-term low-level exposure is the implied mechanism of chronic biological effect — never stated explicitly in Surt's narration
- The outer shell crawlways are not classified as habitable space — they are accessed for maintenance only
