Eli,

My dude. This is not cool. I just opened this chain. It's 2,400 pages. This is a complete brain-drain. You know I hate getting stuff like this. Drop me a 3 line summary by my mid-cycle, then we can setup a pulse for the 9th to chat about potential funding. If you send me another omni-script like this again, I don't care if you've rediscovered the Ark of Noh, I will cap your perms so fast.
