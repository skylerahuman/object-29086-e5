I was tracing the head of the rusted wrench. It was perfect. It always had been. At some point, I'd logged the perfection of the weight of this tool in my hand. I don't remember logging it, but it was in there. Just one line, no more. What more could be said about such a beautiful, perfect tool.
"-sync complete. Sector 724 integrity nominal. Good morning, Surt."
"Good morning, Lares. Thank you for the report," I responded evenly. "I'll be heading down in just a few moments."
Lares would be happy to wait up on me. He was patient like that. I needed to double check the logs. He didn't go through the same training I did, and he had his blind spots..

724 Alpha: 0.00000m variance. Nominal.
Previous spike: 14:54X584B.
System: Stable

Perfect. Lares had been right. The spike was a bit longer than usual, which he had mentioned in his report, but that was inconsequential. 724 Alpha had survived much longer and denser spikes. And 0.00000m variance. Perfect as always. That was what I loved about my job. No variance. Other crew teams would face huge variances in there day-to-day, but not me. I was stable. I cared about my work.

"I looked into your request, Surt," Lares voice was a bit fuzzy of the data link hanging round my neck. Likely radio static from the longer spike. It should itself out soon.

"Yeah, how's that turning out?"

"It appears as though the log manifest remains empty. I am sorry. You are one of the Yosaminus's finest workers. I'm sure it will get addressed soon, Surt."

"Thanks buddy."

"Yes of course. You are currently logging 97.3% of all events. Well done, Surt."

"Oh thank you! I guess you can't maintain what you can't log."

I locked Logging Station 04. I didn't want any unsupervised tampering. Even if my hallway was quiet this time of day. I just didn't trust these other workers. They were all so lazy and sneaky.

Slipping on my suit—a bit loose for some reason—I reached for the cell door and twisted open the spooked wheel handle. It was grimy, and I hated the texture of it. I'd asked for cleaning supplies ages ago, but it wasn't in the budget at this time, so I dealt with it as best I could using my suit arm.

"The logs are showing you've been eating slightly less than usual. It seems you're on an extra healthy trend, Surt." Lares voice echoed out into the hallway over the data link.

"Have I? Hmmm. I thought I was eating a perfectly normal amount for a man of my stature." I don't know what a perfectly normal amount would be. There's not really any way to check. But I was eating as much as I remember I always had. Why would I ever eat more or less?

"Well, I think it's just the weather. Or how hard you're working, Surt." He was right. I'd been working hard. The logs showed it. Maybe Evelst would finally get that promotion he was after, with all my hard work. I knew I had to be doing well by him. He always seemed so satisfied with my performance.

"I'm sure Evelst would agree. I'm going to jump on a comms link with Maint-9 and see how hangar bay 722 Beta is looking, Lares. I'll chat again soon."

"Before you go—" I had already plugged in the comms link. It was funny how that worked. Data links and comms links were two totally different things, yet seemingly functionally the same. However, I could never get them to run simultaneously.

"Maint-9, this is Maint-14. How did your functional logs look?"

I waited for a long time. I heard him breathing on the line. I knew he was there. He was always so lazy and slow to reply. My least favorite coworker.

"Morning, Surt," he cut in over a rasping static sound. Possible frequency inference from the spike. It also could've been a respiratory event. Not likely, Maint-9 was roughly the same age as myself—28 years young—and therefore, spritely and positively as healthy as he could be. I will log it as a concern about spike duration having a greater effects on comms links. "You know my name is Gallo, not Maint-9," he spoke quietly, like maybe he thought it was a secret.

"I am trying to keep this call strictly professional, Maint-9. And as you know, my call-sign is Maint-14. Please respect protocol. Have you completed morning logging?"

More static. 18.4s radio silence. Wet noises on Maint-9's end. Unknown origin. Strange.

"Whatever."

"Whatever? Are you saying your logs looked whatever?"

"No you bumbling idiot. The logs looked fine."

"Fine? How can the logs look 'fine'. Either they were nominal, or a measurement was off." Maint-9 was wheezing on the line. Likely laughing at another one of his jokes. A joke at my expense, nonetheless.

"They were nominal. Leave me alone."

"Thank you, Maint-9. Please continue your maintenance schedule."

I disconnected the comms link. My heart rate was elevated, and my face was warm, as I continued down the hallway to my destination. I had been walking for several minutes. I seemed to be moving slower than usual, and my head hurt. Perhaps it wasn't unreasonable to think that Maint-9 could be sick. I felt as though I was getting sick. 

Possible sickness reported.

"Surt, I am confident you are perfectly healthy. In fact, you are the healthiest person on this ship." Lares voice cut through the silence in the hallway as my data link reconnected. He had likely been listening to my conversation with Maint-9. He probably already logged the status of 722 Beta.

"No, don't say that Lares. I'm healthy, but I'm not that healthy."

"Okay Surt. You are not that healthy. My mistake."

"Were you able to log the succesful comms with Maint-9 yet?" I asked him. I spoke quickly. This was urgent. If he hadn't logged it yet, I may have to run back to my logging station to notate the nominal systems before I could go do my job properly.

"Yessir. I logged the comms, Surt."

"Great, thank you. You've saved me a bunch of time. Maint-9 seemed nominal as well."

"Sir, I don't believe he was nominal. I am glad you think so though, Surt."

"What do you mean you don't believe he was nominal?"

"You heard his coughing. He seems to be most unwell, Surt." Lares was always overly concerned about other crew members. He'd probably check on Maint-9 later tonight. Maybe order him some soup if he truly thought he was unwell.

"Nonsense. That was radio static from the longer spike."

"Ah, that is a perfect explanation, Surt. Thank you for your correction, my mistake." Poor Lares. He was honestly one of the dumbest individuals on the ship. To be clear, he was my closest friend, had been for as long as I could remember, but I always found it hard to believe he could know so much and make so many stupid judgement calls.

"I hate to cut you off so quickly, Lares, but you know I've got to call Maint-22 and check his report. Rather urgent now, right?"

"Surt, you are right on schedule as always. But I do understand the urgency. You're doing excellent. You make the call, and I'll be right here when you're finished."

I disconnected again and joined another comms link channel. I waited a moment for the connection to buffer. Maint-22 would have slightly more latency than Maint-9. It was my job to check on these two maintenance reports daily before I reached 724 Alpha. If I didn't, and went ahead with my scheduled maintenance, it could be a catastrophe. Luckily, I was thorough in my duties.

"What do you want?" Maint-22 was always joking with me. I enjoyed chatting with him much more than Maint-9. He also kept things strictly professional, and was very to the point. I appreciated this.

"You know what I want, silly!" I figured it'd be great to play along with his joking demeanor. I would've kept things strictly professional with Maint-9, but with Maint-22, I knew he liked me, and I liked him.

"Frick off."

"Now that's no way to talk to a friend." I joked back.

"My maintenance is nominal Maint-14. Please, get on with it." Perfect! Both systems nominal. And Maint-22 was in a good mood. I would normally go back to my conversation with Lares, but since Maint-22 seemed so positive today, I decided to continue chatting with him.

"How has your day been?"

"Until about... 30 seconds ago, it was going peachy. My closest friend's probably dying of some space faring disease, I'm eating garbage food, and I'm crawling down a wet dark hole for what could be the last time of my life." Sarcasm. Fine, if that's how he'd play it today, two could play at that game.

"Wow! You must be miserable! I personally have had much the same luck! My best friend's been silent all morning, I didn't even have breakfast, and I'm about to be joining you in the same dark hole! Aren't we just puddles of sunshine, Maint-22."

He was quiet for a few moments. I could still make out faint sounds on his end, so maybe he was just snickering.

"You really are a piece of work," he finally said, snorting. I knew he'd thought my joke was funny.

"Thank you. Have you been reading anything good lately?"

"Logs."

"You and me both. Mine have been excellent. Nominal across the board."

"Yeah. Same."

"I'll bet your manager is proud. Who are you working under, as of late?"

"Ythnop. Same as always."

"Wow. Ythnop! I forgot about that. He's the best! You are so lucky." Ythnos used to be my manager, according to the logs. It was so long ago, I can't remember now, but I had such high reviews under him, before my promotion. He was always such a joy to work for.

"Sure."

"Did he ever get that promotion he was after?"

"Dunno."

"Hmm. I'll bet he did, with him being such an excellent manager. I know I already said it, but I'll say it again, I loved working for him. I hope you get as much joy from him as I do. I was reading my logs this morning, and saw the funniest thing. 3 months ago, 724 Alpha had a shift of 0.00001m. Can you believe that? Absurd. Whoever was maintaining it at the time must've been so undisciplined. To have let such an integral part of Yosaminus drift so far. This is probably why I was stationed on 724 Alpha and my predecessor was replaced. You probably didn't enjoy working with him at all. I'll bet he didn't even do daily synchronization calls. I just wonder how it even shifts out of whack? What are the mechanics on that. I'm sure you don't know. Neither do I, but I'm just curious. My suit is loose. Lares doesn't seem to know why. Do you?"

"No."

"Hmm. I'll figure it out, if you have any ideas, please, let me know. It's not like it could shrink in the wash, haha. I bet the predecessor just ate too much. Or he was lazy. Lares says I eat the perfect amount, so that's got to be it. The predecessor was lazy. I'll be logging that. Wherever they've moved him to, he didn't log like he was supposed to and he didn't perform proper maintenance. Did you know him?"

"You didn't?"

"Of course not. I replaced him, how would I know him? What was he like?"

"You."

"What do you mean? He was lazy, apparently overweight, and didn't log anything like me. He can't be anything like me. I'm pretty sure I'm the hardest worker on this ship. I take such pride in the state of 724. Maybe you just mean he had my charm? Did you get to talk with him a lot."

"Yeah."

"So what made him like me."

33.9s of radio silence.

"Maint-22, are you there?"

"Yes." He sounded different. He must have reached his site and was focusing on his task. I'd be reaching The Throat soon for my joyous traversal to 724 Alpha, and should probably focus myself. 

"Oh okay. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up the call. Thank you for your support."

24.1s of radio silence. Comms link disconnected.

"Lares, is Maint-22 at his site yet?"

"No, Surt. He is still traversing The Throat." He must've had a bad connection. That would explain it. The Throats could be notoriously bad to our comms links. The comms links were designed far after their technology. They were even worse on the data links, and I'd just arrived at mine.

"I'll chat soon Lares. Time to get to work."
