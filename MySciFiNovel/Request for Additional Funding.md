The recovery of the attached **Object #29086-e5** from the Hadopelagic Trench of the Panthalassic Abyss posed an interesting challenge for the recovery team. Primarily, it challenged the former notion that the "Caesars" of Rome ruled from the Sands of Aethlegard. To find **Site Delta-Sigma-9** (nicknamed the "Vatican Bunker" by those less scholastic) situated roughly 80,000 metric units from Afris-Dust was, in itself, a modern archaeological miracle. A superstructure capable of housing 8.2 million biological units 11,400 metric units beneath sea level posed its own explanatory challenges. But the architecture had been, undoubtedly, Roman. Or at least, similar enough to the structures uncovered via litho-sifting decades before in the Sands of Aethlegard that we could regard it as nothing newly discovered.

The anthrotechnologists have proposed that the Caesars actually may have varied the architecture to adapt to the local societies and only built their own structures when absolutely necessary. We now suppose that the "Emperors" were a stand-in for them in the civilization found in the Asiatic Sea—two names for the same rulers. Current hypotheses support that the Romans ruled by some global (possibly space-faring) **"Hive-Culture."** Terrified of the sun, and utilizing deep-crust mega-cities like Delta-Sigma-9, they ruled from underground. In fact, some scholastic sources claim that Delta-Sigma-9 is the closest to identifying the seat of the mythic Empire humanity has come.

Regardless, the next challenge was decoding the artifact. We suppose our Roman predecessors had far more advanced technology than previously expected; Object #29086-e5 only strengthened this hypothesis. The object is a small tablet with the glyphs **SURT** scratched into the back. It is some form of primitive steel, with no luster or chrome and numerous joining points. Measurements confirm it is about the size of a standard _Tessera Militaris_. We suppose it served the same purpose, issued as a unit to access the _demios_ stored throughout Delta-Sigma-9. Even still, the unit has a single speaker housing in the center. Evidence suggests this device supported real-time translation of Roman Legions' speech into local common tongues for easier communication.

Its mass was documented at **4.2 MUOMs**, though measurements could not be specified as accurately as desired due to continuous fluctuations. Internally, the unit had two core components: an **Aurum-Lattice Spool**, similar to modern recording mediums for data storage, and a **zero-point residual energy oscillating device**. This confirms all suspicions that the device could be encoded with a variety of logging data of Delta-Sigma-9, and also logs of the owner and his _demios_ companion (though we have found only two variants across all the identical replicas of Object #29086-e5—for more information, see the #e5 documentation on the subgroup).

### Summary of Deployment

The unit was issued to all personnel living in the subterranean hive-city. It is supposed the city is an extension of the Roman Empire and was entirely staffed with various ranks of Roman Legionaries to perform the bidding of the Caesar in whatever local jurisdiction this hive-city oversaw (likely ruined by raiders from the **Glass Age** as sources of further glass for their primitive solid-state technologies).

The data the Romans stored was etched at the atomic level, making it trivial for the technoarchivists to unravel the hidden messages of each of these ancient relics and reify their text. The specific methodology employed is the well-documented strategy of **Cerebral-Reification**. Fortunately, unlike the Glass Age neophytes, our Roman ancestors used similar **Auditory Hallucinations** to store data on atomic ribbons.

### Chronal Data and Logic Grading

There was some challenge in decoding the ancient **"Augur" Code** that runs these computational devices. The raw chronal flux was **152.9 MB** of data (I realize that better notations exist than Glass Age, but for the layman, we will maintain the common standard). The total epistolary length (as decoded thus far) stands at **611,408 lexical units**, making this the most extensive piece of context from the age. Additionally, the events captured span 7.1 lunar cycles, though the author of the logs seems not to care for the seasons or times.

The technoarchivists did pass on an interesting and important note: they graded the computational complexity at **L99, omniscient logic.** This is likely an advanced spatio-geometric divination method that allowed such high logic capacity, as it exceeds even our modern technology. I have forwarded a request to **Corporal Servus** on the outer band, currently studying the observed anomaly at OJ287. There is evidence this is the same logic running the computational system identified by his team. Perhaps their system also runs on Augur Code.

### Comparative Extraction Sample

Finally, I turn the object over to the interested student. After three generations of **TitanL1 class automata** ran inferences against the dataset found on the tablet to resolve translation issues and the text was properly reified, the problem of cluttered logs remained. For example:

> Thanks lares. Where would I be without you :)
> Getting to work now.
> ```

To make for simpler reading, the technoarchivists elected to clean the data up and standardize it via the TitanL1's contextual synthesis:

> _Ambient RF Burst Detected. Liquefaction in Sector 724Alpha._
> 
> _"Still here, Surt still here, unknown burst observed, stay awake. Environmental containment re-nominal. Surt, your continued operation is, as always, a genuine bright spot in this sector; logging continued per Directive 7.4.1-CORP."_
> 
> _"Thanks Lares," I responded, "Where would I be without you?" Lares did always put a smile on my face. "I'm getting to work now."_

As you can see from the re-encoding, the TitanL1 class automata were allowed some creative freedom to entertain additional contextualization to create a more interesting study. To parse 612,000 lexical units worth of log data would have been far too costly. As a result of this creative freedom and their exceptional performance as of late, I am pleased to report the attached object has been reduced in size from **152.9 MB** of data to **28.2 MB** of human-readable text.

### The Request

Given the nature of the project and the ever-evolving, impressive capacity of the TitanL1 to handle whatever we throw at it, my team and I urgently request an increase in funding to handle further extraction and reification. I am happy to join **Pulse** and chat about this, but the most recent find is monumental.

My estimate is we will need an additional **$1.8 billion** in funding to complete our study by the end of the year. I am sure you will oblige, given this impressive finding and the ever-evolving nature of our project.

Sincerely,
Elias Rachvol
