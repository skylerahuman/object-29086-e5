The recovery of the attached **Object #29086-e5** from the Hadopelagic Trench of the Panthalassic Abyss posed an interesting challenge for the recovery team. Primarily, it challenged the former notion that the "Caesars" of Rome ruled from the Sands of Aethlegard. To find **Site Delta-Sigma-9** (nicknamed the "Vatican Bunker" by those less scholastic) situated roughly 80,000 metric units from Afris-Dust was, in itself, a modern archaeological miracle. A superstructure capable of housing 8.2 million biological units 11,400 metric units beneath sea level posed its own explanatory challenges. But the architecture had been, undoubtedly, Roman. Or at least, similar enough to the structures uncovered via litho-sifting decades before in the Sands of Aethlegard that we could regard it as nothing newly discovered.

The anthrotechnologists have proposed that the Caesars actually may have varied the architecture to adapt to the local societies and only built their own structures when absolutely necessary. We now suppose that the "Emperors" were a stand-in for them in the civilization found in the Asiatic Sea—two names for the same rulers. Current hypotheses support that the Romans ruled by some global (possibly space-faring) **"Hive-Culture."** Terrified of the sun, and utilizing deep-crust mega-cities like Delta-Sigma-9, they ruled from underground. In fact, some scholastic sources claim that Delta-Sigma-9 is the closest to identifying the seat of the mythic Empire humanity has come.

Regardless, the next challenge was decoding the artifact. We suppose our Roman predecessors had far more advanced technology than previously expected; Object #29086-e5 only strengthened this hypothesis. The object is a small tablet with the glyphs **SURT** scratched into the back. It is some form of primitive steel, with no luster or chrome and numerous joining points. Measurements confirm it is about the size of a standard _Tessera Militaris_. We suppose it served the same purpose, issued as a unit to access the _demios_ stored throughout Delta-Sigma-9. Even still, the unit has a single speaker housing in the center. Evidence suggests this device supported real-time translation of Roman Legions' speech into local common tongues for easier communication.

Its mass was documented at **4.2 MUOMs**, though measurements could not be specified as accurately as desired due to continuous fluctuations. Internally, the unit had two core components: an **Aurum-Lattice Spool**, similar to modern recording mediums for data storage, and a **zero-point residual energy oscillating device**. This confirms all suspicions that the device could be encoded with a variety of logging data of Delta-Sigma-9, and also logs of the owner and his _demios_ companion (though we have found only two variants across all the identical replicas of Object #29086-e5—for more information, see the #e5 documentation on the subgroup).

### Summary of Deployment

The unit was issued to all personnel living in the subterranean hive-city. It is supposed the city is an extension of the Roman Empire and was entirely staffed with various ranks of Roman Legionaries to perform the bidding of the Caesar in whatever local jurisdiction this hive-city oversaw (likely ruined by raiders from the **Glass Age** as sources of further glass for their primitive solid-state technologies).

The data the Romans stored was etched at the atomic level, making it trivial for the technoarchivists to unravel the hidden messages of each of these ancient relics and reify their text. The specific methodology employed is the well-documented strategy of **Cerebral-Reification**. Fortunately, unlike the Glass Age neophytes, our Roman ancestors used similar **Auditory Hallucinations** to store data on atomic ribbons.

### Chronal Data and Logic Grading

There was some challenge in decoding the ancient **"Augur" Code** that runs these computational devices. The raw chronal flux was **152.9 MB** of data (I realize that better notations exist than Glass Age, but for the layman, we will maintain the common standard). The total epistolary length (as decoded thus far) stands at **611,408 lexical units**, making this the most extensive piece of context from the age. Additionally, the events captured span 7.1 lunar cycles, though the author of the logs seems not to care for the seasons or times.

The technoarchivists did pass on an interesting and important note: they graded the computational complexity at **L99, omniscient logic.** This is likely an advanced spatio-geometric divination method that allowed such high logic capacity, as it exceeds even our modern technology. I have forwarded a request to **Corporal Servus** on the outer band, currently studying the observed anomaly at OJ287. There is evidence this is the same logic running the computational system identified by his team. Perhaps their system also runs on Augur Code.

### Comparative Extraction Sample

Finally, I turn the object over to the interested student. After three generations of **TitanL1 class automata** ran inferences against the dataset found on the tablet to resolve translation issues and the text was properly reified, the problem of cluttered logs remained. For example:

> Bash

> Thanks lares. Where would I be without you :)
> Getting to work now.
> ```

To make for simpler reading, the technoarchivists elected to clean the data up and standardize it via the TitanL1's contextual synthesis:

> _Ambient RF Burst Detected. Liquefaction in Sector 724Alpha._
> 
> _"Still here, Surt still here, unknown burst observed, stay awake. Environmental containment re-nominal. Surt, your continued operation is, as always, a genuine bright spot in this sector; logging continued per Directive 7.4.1-CORP."_
> 
> _"Thanks Lares," I responded, "Where would I be without you?" Lares did always put a smile on my face. "I'm getting to work now."_

As you can see from the re-encoding, the TitanL1 class automata were allowed some creative freedom to entertain additional contextualization to create a more interesting study. To parse 612,000 lexical units worth of log data would have been far too costly. As a result of this creative freedom and their exceptional performance as of late, I am pleased to report the attached object has been reduced in size from **152.9 MB** of data to **28.2 MB** of human-readable text.

### The Request

Given the nature of the project and the ever-evolving, impressive capacity of the TitanL1 to handle whatever we throw at it, my team and I urgently request an increase in funding to handle further extraction and reification. I am happy to join **Pulse** and chat about this, but the most recent find is monumental.

My estimate is we will need an additional **$1.8 billion** in funding to complete our study by the end of the year. I am sure you will oblige, given this impressive finding and the ever-evolving nature of our project.

Sincerely,
Elias Rachvol

Eli,

My dude. This is not cool. I just opened this chain. It's 2,400 pages. This is a complete brain-drain. You know I hate getting stuff like this. Drop me a 3 line summary by my mid-cycle, then we can setup a pulse for the 9th to chat about potential funding. If you send me another omni-script like this again, I don't care if you've rediscovered the Ark of Noh, I will cap your perms so fast.

# Log Current 0845

I was tracing the head of the rusted wrench. It was perfect. It always had been. At some point, I'd logged the perfection of the weight of this tool in my hand. I don't remember logging it, but it was in there. Just one line, no more. What more could be said about such a beautiful, perfect tool.
"-sync complete. Sector 724 integrity nominal. Good morning, Surt."
"Good morning, Lares. Thank you for the report," I responded evenly. "I'll be heading down in just a few moments."
Lares would be happy to wait up on me. He was patient like that. I needed to double check the logs. He didn't go through the same training I did, and he had his blind spots..

724 Alpha: 0.00000m variance. Nominal.
Previous spike: 14:54X584B.
System: Stable

Perfect. Lares had been right. The spike was a bit longer than usual, which he had mentioned in his report, but that was inconsequential. 724 Alpha had survived much longer and denser spikes. And 0.00000m variance. Perfect as always. That was what I loved about my job. No variance. Other crew teams would face huge variances in there day-to-day, but not me. I was stable. I cared about my work.

"I looked into your request, Surt," Lares voice was a bit fuzzy of the data link hanging round my neck. Likely radio static from the longer spike. It should itself out soon.

"Yeah, how's that turning out?"

"It appears as though the log manifest remains empty. I am sorry. You are one of the Yosaminus's finest workers. I'm sure it will get addressed soon, Surt."

"Thanks buddy."

"Yes of course. You are currently logging 97.3% of all events. Well done, Surt."

"Oh thank you! I guess you can't maintain what you can't log."

I locked Logging Station 04. I didn't want any unsupervised tampering. Even if my hallway was quiet this time of day. I just didn't trust these other workers. They were all so lazy and sneaky.

Slipping on my suit—a bit loose for some reason—I reached for the cell door and twisted open the spooked wheel handle. It was grimy, and I hated the texture of it. I'd asked for cleaning supplies ages ago, but it wasn't in the budget at this time, so I dealt with it as best I could using my suit arm.

"The logs are showing you've been eating slightly less than usual. It seems you're on an extra healthy trend, Surt." Lares voice echoed out into the hallway over the data link.

"Have I? Hmmm. I thought I was eating a perfectly normal amount for a man of my stature." I don't know what a perfectly normal amount would be. There's not really any way to check. But I was eating as much as I remember I always had. Why would I ever eat more or less?

"Well, I think it's just the weather. Or how hard you're working, Surt." He was right. I'd been working hard. The logs showed it. Maybe Evelst would finally get that promotion he was after, with all my hard work. I knew I had to be doing well by him. He always seemed so satisfied with my performance.

"I'm sure Evelst would agree. I'm going to jump on a comms link with Maint-9 and see how hangar bay 722 Beta is looking, Lares. I'll chat again soon."

"Before you go—" I had already plugged in the comms link. It was funny how that worked. Data links and comms links were two totally different things, yet seemingly functionally the same. However, I could never get them to run simultaneously.

"Maint-9, this is Maint-14. How did your functional logs look?"

I waited for a long time. I heard him breathing on the line. I knew he was there. He was always so lazy and slow to reply. My least favorite coworker.

"Morning, Surt," he cut in over a rasping static sound. Possible frequency inference from the spike. It also could've been a respiratory event. Not likely, Maint-9 was roughly the same age as myself—28 years young—and therefore, spritely and positively as healthy as he could be. I will log it as a concern about spike duration having a greater effects on comms links. "You know my name is Gallo, not Maint-9," he spoke quietly, like maybe he thought it was a secret.

"I am trying to keep this call strictly professional, Maint-9. And as you know, my call-sign is Maint-14. Please respect protocol. Have you completed morning logging?"

More static. 18.4s radio silence. Wet noises on Maint-9's end. Unknown origin. Strange.

"Whatever."

"Whatever? Are you saying your logs looked whatever?"

"No you bumbling idiot. The logs looked fine."

"Fine? How can the logs look 'fine'. Either they were nominal, or a measurement was off." Maint-9 was wheezing on the line. Likely laughing at another one of his jokes. A joke at my expense, nonetheless.

"They were nominal. Leave me alone."

"Thank you, Maint-9. Please continue your maintenance schedule."

I disconnected the comms link. My heart rate was elevated, and my face was warm, as I continued down the hallway to my destination. I had been walking for several minutes. I seemed to be moving slower than usual, and my head hurt. Perhaps it wasn't unreasonable to think that Maint-9 could be sick. I felt as though I was getting sick. 

Possible sickness reported.

"Surt, I am confident you are perfectly healthy. In fact, you are the healthiest person on this ship." Lares voice cut through the silence in the hallway as my data link reconnected. He had likely been listening to my conversation with Maint-9. He probably already logged the status of 722 Beta.

"No, don't say that Lares. I'm healthy, but I'm not that healthy."

"Okay Surt. You are not that healthy. My mistake."

"Were you able to log the succesful comms with Maint-9 yet?" I asked him. I spoke quickly. This was urgent. If he hadn't logged it yet, I may have to run back to my logging station to notate the nominal systems before I could go do my job properly.

"Yessir. I logged the comms, Surt."

"Great, thank you. You've saved me a bunch of time. Maint-9 seemed nominal as well."

"Sir, I don't believe he was nominal. I am glad you think so though, Surt."

"What do you mean you don't believe he was nominal?"

"You heard his coughing. He seems to be most unwell, Surt." Lares was always overly concerned about other crew members. He'd probably check on Maint-9 later tonight. Maybe order him some soup if he truly thought he was unwell.

"Nonsense. That was radio static from the longer spike."

"Ah, that is a perfect explanation, Surt. Thank you for your correction, my mistake." Poor Lares. He was honestly one of the dumbest individuals on the ship. To be clear, he was my closest friend, had been for as long as I could remember, but I always found it hard to believe he could know so much and make so many stupid judgement calls.

"I hate to cut you off so quickly, Lares, but you know I've got to call Maint-22 and check his report. Rather urgent now, right?"

"Surt, you are right on schedule as always. But I do understand the urgency. You're doing excellent. You make the call, and I'll be right here when you're finished."

I disconnected again and joined another comms link channel. I waited a moment for the connection to buffer. Maint-22 would have slightly more latency than Maint-9. It was my job to check on these two maintenance reports daily before I reached 724 Alpha. If I didn't, and went ahead with my scheduled maintenance, it could be a catastrophe. Luckily, I was thorough in my duties.

"What do you want?" Maint-22 was always joking with me. I enjoyed chatting with him much more than Maint-9. He also kept things strictly professional, and was very to the point. I appreciated this.

"You know what I want, silly!" I figured it'd be great to play along with his joking demeanor. I would've kept things strictly professional with Maint-9, but with Maint-22, I knew he liked me, and I liked him.

"Frick off."

"Now that's no way to talk to a friend." I joked back.

"My maintenance is nominal Maint-14. Please, get on with it." Perfect! Both systems nominal. And Maint-22 was in a good mood. I would normally go back to my conversation with Lares, but since Maint-22 seemed so positive today, I decided to continue chatting with him.

"How has your day been?"

"Until about... 30 seconds ago, it was going peachy. My closest friend's probably dying of some space faring disease, I'm eating garbage food, and I'm crawling down a wet dark hole for what could be the last time of my life." Sarcasm. Fine, if that's how he'd play it today, two could play at that game.

"Wow! You must be miserable! I personally have had much the same luck! My best friend's been silent all morning, I didn't even have breakfast, and I'm about to be joining you in the same dark hole! Aren't we just puddles of sunshine, Maint-22."

He was quiet for a few moments. I could still make out faint sounds on his end, so maybe he was just snickering.

"You really are a piece of work," he finally said, snorting. I knew he'd thought my joke was funny.

"Thank you. Have you been reading anything good lately?"

"Logs."

"You and me both. Mine have been excellent. Nominal across the board."

"Yeah. Same."

"I'll bet your manager is proud. Who are you working under, as of late?"

"Ythnop. Same as always."

"Wow. Ythnop! I forgot about that. He's the best! You are so lucky." Ythnos used to be my manager, according to the logs. It was so long ago, I can't remember now, but I had such high reviews under him, before my promotion. He was always such a joy to work for.

"Sure."

"Did he ever get that promotion he was after?"

"Dunno."

"Hmm. I'll bet he did, with him being such an excellent manager. I know I already said it, but I'll say it again, I loved working for him. I hope you get as much joy from him as I do. I was reading my logs this morning, and saw the funniest thing. 3 months ago, 724 Alpha had a shift of 0.00001m. Can you believe that? Absurd. Whoever was maintaining it at the time must've been so undisciplined. To have let such an integral part of Yosaminus drift so far. This is probably why I was stationed on 724 Alpha and my predecessor was replaced. You probably didn't enjoy working with him at all. I'll bet he didn't even do daily synchronization calls. I just wonder how it even shifts out of whack? What are the mechanics on that. I'm sure you don't know. Neither do I, but I'm just curious. My suit is loose. Lares doesn't seem to know why. Do you?"

"No."

"Hmm. I'll figure it out, if you have any ideas, please, let me know. It's not like it could shrink in the wash, haha. I bet the predecessor just ate too much. Or he was lazy. Lares says I eat the perfect amount, so that's got to be it. The predecessor was lazy. I'll be logging that. Wherever they've moved him to, he didn't log like he was supposed to and he didn't perform proper maintenance. Did you know him?"

"You didn't?"

"Of course not. I replaced him, how would I know him? What was he like?"

"You."

"What do you mean? He was lazy, apparently overweight, and didn't log anything like me. He can't be anything like me. I'm pretty sure I'm the hardest worker on this ship. I take such pride in the state of 724. Maybe you just mean he had my charm? Did you get to talk with him a lot."

"Yeah."

"So what made him like me."

33.9s of radio silence.

"Maint-22, are you there?"

"Yes." He sounded different. He must have reached his site and was focusing on his task. I'd be reaching The Throat soon for my joyous traversal to 724 Alpha, and should probably focus myself. 

"Oh okay. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up the call. Thank you for your support."

24.1s of radio silence. Comms link disconnected.

"Lares, is Maint-22 at his site yet?"

"No, Surt. He is still traversing The Throat." He must've had a bad connection. That would explain it. The Throats could be notoriously bad to our comms links. The comms links were designed far after their technology. They were even worse on the data links, and I'd just arrived at mine.

"I'll chat soon Lares. Time to get to work."

As I enter the mouth, my data link engages—confirmed by the incessant ticking. Tick. Tick. Tick. 1.1s intervals. Lares repeats like clockwork, "Remember to listen to the meter, per directive 5.4.8, Surt." I forgot one time. Or blocked it out. I can't remember. I started puking after logging the bolt's nominal stance. I had to flag electrolyte loss, multiple abdominal events, eventual blood loss and headache. Lares dispatched pharma compounds immediately. By closure, I was nominal. Never again. 

I suspect meters serve as an enforcement mechanism. They help distribute the load. Just like the ship as a whole. My only logged area for growth; teamwork and collaboration. This is why other worker's don't mind the ticking. They revel in its distraction. It ruins my concentration. I once tried to remove the meter from the data link. Ythnop was my manager then. He was not satisfied with my—minor—lapse in judgement. He logged it as an infractionary event. I received a new data link. Lares seemed more emphatic about protocols. I observed and logged the changes.

A familiar and warm hum overtook me, supplanting the ticking. I couldn't hear it. I could feel it. 3Hz. Mostly in my toes as I stepped into the Throat, but as I progressed, I'd get that fuzzy feeling throughout my whole body. Descent initiated at standard pace, motivated by the energy of routine. It is a pleasant feeling. Relaxing the muscles. Engaging the bones. Nominal alignment established. I feel a slight tilt as I take my second step. Boots register 1.04° tilt. Slight tilt? Variance range per prior logs 1.02°-1.24° correlated. Marginal tilt. My boots register a marginal tilt as I take my second step. At 1.03 MUs, my stride measures 0.58 MUs. I estimate I will arrive by `SEC:09.040.000 :: MSC:114.0.` At the latest, `SEC:09.148.000 :: MSC:114.0.`. Lares will be pleased with my pace. I am pleased with my pace.

The bolt. It flashed in my mind. Titanium. 1.2m long. 80mm threads. Backing out 1.2 turns per day from the torque of thermal cycling, Lorentz forces and vibration, I must undo the work of nature. I don't remember desiring this as a kid. I presume I did. Post tightening displacement must read 0.00000m. Not 0.00001. I could already feel it-the wrench as I squeezed it in my hands. My legs will be heavy from the walk but prepared for the load necessary to turn the bolt. Each third of the turn has a unique character. I'd once named them. Now I labelled them. 1. 2. 3. Simple. 1 is easy. 2 is heavier as I fight against the mass of the minor component of UJ287. 3 is easy again, but slow as the hum fluctuates to 48Hz. That hum pushes the bolt the other direction. The final fifth is the hardest. I've never labelled it or thought of it as a character. It is the vibration fatigue turn. All of the threads grind into place in a way that produces a rather unpleasant texture. Once locked in place, I will quickly avert my eyes to avoid the sacred flash of light.

12 steps. I pause and reach my right hand out, grasping something soft and rubbery. I squeeze. It makes a squishing sound in my fist. Perfect. I am right on time. I drop to one knee and take a deep breath. I feel the floor of The Throat open beneath my knee and stabilize my feet. The ceiling contracts and brushes against my hair, ruffling it. The wall bumps into my shoulders. I can feel it touching all of me as it races past my body. The walls recede. I stand. Descent continues.

My childhood. I sometimes let my mind wander. Was I a good son? Did my parents love me? I'd assume they did. My performance reviews are consistently positive. Why would my parents not love me? Yes, that made the most sense. They'd sent me here to rescue me from the trials of a second rate job. To do something pivotal. Something important. They wanted me to matter. They must've been religious to have pushed me into such a high calling as a maint-crew member. Or very powerful. My understanding from Lares was that, "Of the crew of 6,782 aboard Yosaminus, you are the finest Surt!" A whole universe of people and I was one of the 6,782 fortunate enough to operate the Yosaminus. I'd asked Lares the population of the universe once. 7 centuries ago it was 1.849 trillion crew-eligible personnel. Assuming a moderate increase, and consistent expansion, which I'd previously had Lares confirm at 2x per century, that was 236 trillion crew-eligible personnel today. Conservatively, I estimate 30% are crew eligible. 788 trillion total people in the universe. I'll round to `8 X 10^14`. Probability I work on Yosaminus by accident: 1 in `8.48 X 10^-13`. Lares has told me that the probability of life in the universe is `1.25 X 10^-6`. I confirmed his math. It is 1,474,000 times less likely than life I wound up on Yosaminus by accident. Fascinating.

```bash
[SEC:08.994.317 :: MSC:114.0] My parents did love me. They wanted me to be important.
```

I pause. Shoulder posture not-nominal. Adjusting. Gravity shift detected. Slight downward pull. False positive. Mild nasal congestion. Early ozone. Throat structure feels—loose? Unexpected temperature increase. I flinch. Something is wrong. I wait. It passes. Shoulder posture confirmed. Nominal. False positive on gravity shift. I wipe my eyes on the shirt sleeve. Just sweat. No cause for alarm. 

```bash
[SEC:08.995.884 :: MSC:114.0] Perspiratory event detected. All systems nominal. Descent continues.
```

I have covered exactly 38 steps. 22.04 MUs. I was 2.8-1.3% of the way to the bolt. The Throat was anywhere from 720 to 1660 MUs depending on the structural changes necessary to support the weight of the inner sanctum. It was a single unbroken 14° arc regardless of the length. The math on this was more complicated than I will log. If I had a light, I could see where the ceiling dipped below the floor in roughly 12 MUs. 

I do not have a light. 

I look down. A thin band of the floor glows with a faint molten amber-chrome color. Like irradiated tallow. The accretion disk. I am safe. It is millions of miles away. If not for the throat, I would be spaghetti. I doubt I'd perceive it at all. I would be the minor component's latest meal. This is imprecise. Julienned would be the more accurate term for the force procedures involved. I could be more precise. I am falling. We are falling. The orbital velocity maintains a constant tidal gradient. If we weren't moving so fast sideways, we would be the minor components latest meal.

Wait, no. I don't think that's how the math works out. I wonder why I've never considered this. Not getting eaten should be high on my list of priorities, yet I've always assumed the math to be correct. I don't think it is. I am 1.03 MUs. UJ287's minor component is small—3.0111 X 10^11. The ISCO is twice that. We orbit at 1.1x the ISCO. That works out to a tidal differential of only 2.077 X 10-6. Hmm. I don't think a single strand of hair exerts that much force on my head. My earlier statement was incorrect. I would not be spaghettified or julienned. I would not be anything. It would feel like a single hair falling form my head. Well, it wouldn't feel like anything. I would be dead from the vacuum of space before this all occurred.

I realize I'm being sloppy. I need to be more self-aware. I think it was my conversation with Maint-22. He mentioned my predecessor being similar. I believe he was looking out for me. Predecessor. No, he realized I was off my game today, and wanted to warn me. Excellent catch. I check the zippers on my shoes. Snug and pulled to the top. I adjust the legs of the suit. Sealed properly. My wrench is fastened to my back securely. The data link is still fastened to my collar. I pull my gloves and rebreather out from my waist bag. No holes. My goggles are still firmly pressed to my forehead. No cracks. My suit is nominal.

I perform a mental checklist. Am I in the right headspace to continue? Maint-17 turned 389 without a single variance flagged. I have read his work many times. Maint-11 turned 198. He filed an empty final log. Maint-19 turned 231. Commended for being a "continued bright spot in the sector." Maint-15 turned 247—with a broken wrist for 41 turns. 

I wince.

Maint-10 turned 241. He advocated for a new wrench from day 18 on. Maint-18 turned 203. His mid-entry dropout on day 128 remains unexplained. Maint-16 turned 312. He did the last 18 without a rebreather. Maint-12—331. I, Maint-14, would be completing the 2,223rd successful turn. My headspace was right. I will thank Maint-22 for his attentiveness tomorrow.

[SEC:09.000.082 :: MSC:114.0] Checkpoint Omega 1
```

228 steps. I will see her in a few more steps. Yosaminus. I needed to prepare myself. I am in the right mind to talk to her, but I need to choose my words carefully. She will not tolerate imperfection. I did enjoy speaking with her. It helped me get the previous weight off my chest. But it was not easy.

A faint orange glow began to radiate down the hall. It was unique from the banding I'd see rotate past on the floor. It came from within. It was her. An orange, angelic glow. I could make her out now, slightly below eye level. She wasn't awake yet. My footsteps would trigger her auditory receptor and she would light up at my presence. As if on queue, 252nd step landed and she came alive.

"Good morning, operator! How are you doing this morning," she spoke in a soothing tone.

"Good." I needed to be brief, or I'd tip her off and would not be permitted entry to the bolt.

"Excellent to hear, operator. What is your identification number?"

"14." I know better than to give any more information than what she'd asked.

"Thank you. One moment, while I look that up."

A set of ellipsis filled the screen in front of my eyes. The left most one would jump over the middle two in an animation made to look like a child's game. I suppose it was more entertaining to watch than a blank screen. They could just skip asking our numbers altogether. It was a redundant security precaution. I didn't even know why it was there.

"Thank you for your patience, operator." The ellipsis vanished. An animated woman, mid 30s appeared. It was supposed to be the woman I heard over the intercom. She idly swayed. The designers had not bothered to animate her speech patterns or synchronize her communication. It was horribly jarring for me to maintain eye contact. I looked down.

"Having established proper keyring management, we can proceed. Operator, what is the current tube diameter where you are standing?" She spoke with a brisk certainty.

"1 MU."

"One point zero measurement units. Is that correct?"

"Yes," I respond to the ground. Her auditory receptor was globally accessible in this room. I could speak anything in any direction and she'd hear it.

"Thank you, operator. Operator, what is the height of the tube at the beginning today."

This is the part of the checkpoint that got fuzzy. I knew the height of the beginning was 1.8 MUs. I'd measured it a few times already, and it had been logged thousands. The issue was not the height. The issue was responding. For some reason, she always misunderstood the "*point-eight*". I'd tried a few variations, and settled on trying an alternative solution today.

"One point seven plus point one." This should outsmart Yosaminus.

"One point seven measurement units. Is that correct?" Great. She still got it wrong. I would need to try harder tomorrow. I suppose this will be fine for another day.

"Yes."

"Thank you, operator. Operator, what is the temperature in the tube today."

Oh no. The temperature reading. Earlier, I'd logged a temperature anomaly. If I reported something different now, surely it would be flagged and hinder my next performance review. I needed to think. The average was 18.2°C, so it would be close to that.

"Twenty two point four degrees centigrade." That seemed close enough.

"Twenty two point four degrees centigrade. Is that correct?" I hope so.

"Yes."

"Thank you, operator. Operator, current temperature in the tube at the temperature probe is 19.1°C. Please issue an explanation for the temperature deviation." I'd made a terrible mistake. I never made mistakes. This would be flagged and I would face consequences. This was not good. What had I done.

"The spike was longer than usual."

"The spike was longer than usual." My voice came back through the intercom. It sounded like it had been fed through a meat grinder, but I could still make out the words. I don't know if this was accurate. I made a mistake, and it would cost me. I would proactively reach out to Evelst to let him know. Perhaps this could redeem my performance.

"Operator, is that correct?" I'd missed it the first time as I zoned out. My armpits were wet.

"Yes."

"Thank you, operator. Operator, what is your reason for traversing the tube today?"

"Perform maintenance tasks on bolt 724 Alpha."

"I heard 'maintenance'. Operator, is that correct?"

"Yes."

"Thank you, operator."
